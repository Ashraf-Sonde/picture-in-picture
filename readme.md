## Picture in Picture <br>
In this project you can select a media stream you want to be in picture-in-picture and then click the start button to initialize the sharing of the stream. Preferably you should open the stream in another vitrual desktop and view full screen there in order to take full advantage of this project. <br><br>
This project is useful if you want to watch video and do some other task at the same without switching between tabs. You can simply resize the window of picture-in-picture box and drag it around the screen where its comfortable for you.
